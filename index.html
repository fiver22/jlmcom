    <h3>This Is My Simple Website</h3>
    <p>This is a simple web page. I am not able to make a very complex page, and I don't like them much. I think this might be a blog kind of thing. Dunno. I miss the old web -and while I can recreate some of the simple aesthetic of the old web, I don't know that I have the content to populate a personal site. We'll see. </p>
    
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>I'm doing this out of boredom; to learn; and to create something (small)</p>
    
    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>Here's where you'd see links to cool sites. They are getting harder to find... the internet is reddit and twitter and facebook and I'm hardly going to link to those. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.bfoliver.com">https://www.bfoliver.com/</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.some.other.site">another intersting site would go here but I can't think of any right now and I'm literally just learning this.And hey look, this is a link but not really. I'm sure there's a way to fix this even if it is just a place holder</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Preformatted Text</h4>
    <pre>
I mean, preformatted text is pretty cool. I'm putting this in so I know I can.
