        <h3>This Is My Simple Website</h3>
        <p>This is a simple web page. I am not able to make a very complex page, and I don't like them much. I think this might be a blog kind of thing. Dunno. I miss the old web -and while I can recreate some of the simple aesthetic of the old web, I don't know that I have the content to populate a personal site. We'll see.</p>
    
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>I'm doing this out of boredom; to learn; and to create something (small)</p>

        <h3>Recent Blog Posts</h3>
        <section>
            <h4>Recent Posts</h4>
            <article>
                <h3><a class="blog-link" href="/pages/blog/20241027.html">2024-10-27: I'm sick</a></h3>
            </article>
            <!-- Add more blog links as new posts are created -->
        </section>
    
        <h3>Links</h3>
        <p>Here's where you'd see links to cool sites. They are getting harder to find... the internet is reddit and twitter and facebook and I'm hardly going to link to those. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://www.bfoliver.com">Ben Oliver's site</a><span class="credit-text"> - an old friend. baconBits was a lovely time</li>
            <li><a href="https://jrs-s.net">JRS Systems: the blog</a><span class="credit-text"> - a smart guy, Nev001 shared this in a Discord server I watch</span></li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Preformatted Text</h4>
        <pre>
I mean, preformatted text is pretty cool. I'm putting this in so I know I can.
