# TODO List for jlmcom (see also PROGRESS_NEXT.md
- 1) I want to extend the preview and change formatting for blog entries.
- 2) Need to have a better workflow for adding a blog entry, as it stands I nee dto build the usniverse first :/ 
- 3) need to fix sidebar js or how it relates to the main content? see blogpost 2024-10-28 how the main content text overflows into the sidebar area like that space isn't reserved.
- 4) some progress made on '2)', but still a bit fucked. I need new blogposts to auto populate /index.html automatically. 
- 7) so cool if I could add rss. so. cool. 
- 8) clean up all html/css to remove redundencies and make it all consistent
- 9) look at the way tags appear -there's a better way
- 10) might I neeed a general tempolate or way to auto insert info like sidebar, footer to each page?  

--
1) wip some stuff done
2) this is important, it's pretty complex, I have started to address this with a script but i still need to do a lot of linking -to /index.html, and to /pages/blog/index.html
3) may be done...need to watch for it on new pages
4) technically done but more work in relation to 1 and 2
5) could possibly rm genBlog.py, genTags.py and they are integrated into blogManager.py. Might also want to rename blogManager.py to genBlog.py
