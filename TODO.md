# TODO List for jlmcom
- 1) I want to extend the preview and change formatting for blog entries.
- 2) Need to have a better workflow for adding a blog entry, as it stands I nee dto build the usniverse first :/ 
- 3) need to fix sidebar js or how it relates to the main content? see blogpost 2024-10-28 how the main content text overflows into the sidebar area like that space isn't reserved.
- 4) some progress made on '2)', but still a bit fucked. I need new blogposts to auto populate /index.html automatically. 
- 7) so cool if I could add rss. so. cool. 

--
1) wip some stuff done
2) this is important, it's pretty complex, I have started to address this with a script but i still need to do a lot of linking -to /index.html, and to /pages/blog/index.html
