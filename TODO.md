# TODO List for jlmcom
-need to link pages/blog/{files} to indix.html, or blog/index.html -this is now half done, I want to extend the preview and change formatting.

- tags.json shows some weird empty tags, this means, I suppose, that the gentags.js need to be adjusted to ignore empty tags, or i could stop using empty tags.

- fix sidebar code for gaming.html -maybe all pages as it should reference the script
