# TODO List for jlmcom
- 1) I want to extend the preview and change formatting for blog entries.
- 2) Need to have a better workflow for adding a blog entry, as it stands I nee dto build the usniverse first :/ 
- 3) need to fix sidebar js or how it relates to the main content? see blogpost 2024-10-28 how the main content text overflows into the sidebar area like that space isn't reserved.
- 4) some progress made on '2)', but still a bit fucked. I need new blogposts to auto populate /index.html automatically. 
- 5) I should probs make a links page and move the links off of /index.html
- 6) clean up /index.html more, remove the preformated text example
