    <h4>20241028</h4>
    <p>I watched a film, the latest Alien Film. Alien ?Romulus? I really enjoyed the beginning. I particularly enjoyed the tone and feel of the early parts of the film and I think the two leads were really very good -Calie Spaeny as whatever her name is and David Johnson as that android guy.</p> 
     <p>There's a clever joke or at least something interesting to say about the main actor's name containing an "ash" -though i just looked it up and not all 'ae's are etymologucally related to Ã¦ so I dunno. I didn;t dislikeany of the performances but Rook looked like ...he/it looked really bad. I hate to shit on someone's work and it may have been a choice too over my head to appreciate or there may have been no money or the director might have been a jerk to the vfx ppl but there's a special disgust I feel for bad cgi humans (or androids) -it's never been done well. At least not that I've seen. Not in whatever Star Wars continuation, not in The Irishman. </p>  
	<p>It fell apart, though -maybe starting with the reveal of the nostalgia stroking Rook. The thing didn;t have to go off the rails there but it was the first spot where I thought 'this could be a sign of flailing'. Some time after that I got a bit lost in the chaos of events -I'm sure they made sense with analysis or that someone could explain it to me but I got pretty confused with why certain characters did what and when (there may be a longer edit which would have cleared that up -or help my hand, depending on your perspective. What I really disliked was the endless endings. What I laughed at (not with) was the very cringe inducing "die, bitch" -or someting like that. </p>
<p> I'm not a film critic, and my very best effort at making a film would be hilariously bad even if I had a 100 million dollar budget</p>
