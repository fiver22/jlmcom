    reading became hard
    <h4>20241114</h4>
    <p>I've read for as long as I can remember. Eventually, like...may people I switched almost completely to audiobooks -which I still really love, but I decided to read the written word again and find it harder than it should be. Where I used to read 1 to 4 hours -but The past year I seem to average 30 minutes before I fall asleep or find myself wanting to do something else.</p><p>So in an effort clean up the old pathways I'm re-reading two books: a non fiction called The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking) by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Mack_(astrophysicist)">Katie Mack</a> and for fiction, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation_(VanderMeer_novel)">Annihilation</a> by Jeff VanderMeer.</p><p>I remember enjoying both when I read them originally, and thought they could help me get back in the habbit.
