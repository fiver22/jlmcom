    new domain, new host
    <h4>20241123</h4>
    <p>Today I've switched to a new domain that I think I'll keep for this personal site: <a href="https://whenthebeesaregone.com">whenthebeesaregone.com</a> and I've also moved hosting off of my little personal home server. It's now running on a little vps with 1 vcore and 1GB RAM.</p><p>It's not like I needed a dedicated host but it's part of the learning process for me -and it's nice to have it off of my little home connection.</p><p>With this move I hope this incentivises me to post more regularly and flesh out this site. The point was never to make this  ablog, but that seems to be all I've managed to do so far...maybe not a terrible thing... maybe that's what it should be.</p><p>So this is my first post on a new domain and new host. Exciting stuff. I wonder if posting this will reveal something is not functioning properly...</p>
