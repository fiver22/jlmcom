    Art and Artist
    <h4>20241215</h4>
    <p>I know I'm not even the 500 millionth person to think about this tension. In the past I have thrown away art because the artist said or did something I found stupid or morally questionable. This mostly has occurred with musicians I like but I've had it happen with respect to authors, and visual artists. I think I'm going to lean away from that now.</p><p>There are just too many confused people who make great art.</p>
