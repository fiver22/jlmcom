    <h4>20241112</h4>
    <p>Working on an HP laptop -clone from old hp to new hp is the short of it. Cuctomer buys a new latop -essentially the 2024 version of their previous 2022 model. I assume these are Costco buys. They work, but god I hate them. brittle plastic, hinges snickering from day 1 that they could break. The way they build the thing so tat it's almost impossible not to gouge or even crack the shell if you even want at the storage.</p><p>It makes me appreciate modes that are designed and manufatured to be opened.</p><p>I could easily go on to my problems with Windows but I'm too busy trying to figure out why Windows is doing something weird af. Which is normal. So can it be weird?</p>
