    <p>The Night Before the American Election</p>
<p>yeah... this feels like the end -or the beginning of the end -or the end of the beginning of the end?. <p>I was reminded ,today, that no democracy has ever lasted... to say I'm worried about my neighbours to the south is an understatement. I have a terrible, terrible feeling of doom regardless of the results. I feel like ordinary Americans have discovered that democracy is not something they can do. </p><p>If he wins, it's a nighmare. If he looses I fear his reaction. 
There's a sense that she will win -but a landslide victory is the only thing I can see that could knock back the forces that would see the end of American democracy.
And, of course, the end of the American experiment is not only an end for America -it would not be contained. Already we see political animosity like that seen in the U.S. up here. </p>
<p>Please let me be wrong.</p>
