They still are but I, at least, got it so that newly generated tags will point to the right locations</p><p>The fact that I can't code at all has this bizarre effect where I can't see errors in my code. And even when I find the fix -when I'm TOLD the fix, I can't seem to parse what I'm looking at.</p><p> Well, the next step is manually correcting the previously incorrectly generated paths.</p>
