    <p>was it a waste?</p>
	<p> We arrive at the job site to trace cables and run cables and generally clean up. Nearly the firstthing we did caused a significant network to ...go away. So we scramble tryingto figure out how what we did could possibly have cause what we now see. 5 hours scheduled on site and 4 hours later it turns out a cable that was working just gave up on us. Not fun. I asked if that meant we essentially accomplished nothing and the reply, which made sense, was at least we caused and solved a failure that could easily have happened at a much more chaotic time.
<div id="footer"></div>
<script>
  fetch('/footer.html')
    .then(response => response.text())
    .then(data => {
      document.getElementById('footer').innerHTML = data;
    })
    .catch(error => console.error('Error loading footer:', error));
</script>
