    Spending time with a friend
    <h4>20241110</h4>
    <p>I was lucky to be able to hang out with a good friend today, Jayvo came home from Halifax for the long weekend and made time to hang out with me -I'm super appreciative he did. We took a little walk along <a href="https://saintjohn.ca/en/parks-and-recreation/parks-and-trails/harbour-passage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Harbour Passage</a>. It was nice to get out and Harbour Passage is really very lovely. Great for SJ. Every time I hang out with a friend I find myself a little surprised at how meaningful it is to me.
