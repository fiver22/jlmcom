    <h2>Minecraft</h2>
    <p>Currently playing minecraft. Hosting a server locally and a friend and I play. Using Neoforge and a bunch of cleint plugins and shaders. A few server plugins, one for performance, one for discord integration.
Client side I'm using Prism Launcher on my "gaming pc" which is pretty modest but more than enough for minecraft. I suppose I should say that non java minecraft is the devil or something but I know too many kids who play bedrock or pocket to be that much of a jerk. I would say that I prefer java.</p>

<p>I run the server via docker compose -well, portainer stacks, using <a href="https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server">itzg/docker-minecraft-server</a> a la: </p>

services:
  mc:

    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    restart: unless-stopped

</pre>

<p>(I've removed some details)
Of note: I first tried seting some server.properties in the compose but ended up having to manually add a few files -whitelist, ops, and manually edit server.properties.</p>
