    <h3>Links</h3>
    <p>Look, these are obviously currated -I'm not going to link to
    sites or youtube chans that show what an uncool, flawed, boring
    human I am. I'm also avoiding anything I think that would be
    controversial. Even so if someone on the pages or channels
    below completely lose their shit and start ranting about some
    bullshit...well, I doubt they would, but being flawed humans
    I'm sure something in these links will make you roll your
    eyes.</p>
    <p>Here's where you'd see links to cool sites. They are getting
    harder to find... the internet is reddit and twitter and
    facebook and I'm hardly going to link to those.</p>

    on YT but it's GOOG's world and we just live in it</p>
